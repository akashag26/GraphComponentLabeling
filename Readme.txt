This project contains the following files:

1. GraphComponentLabeling.java: An optimized algorithm to solve graph Component Labeling on a CPU.
2. GraphComponentLabelingUnion.java: An optimized algorithm to solve graph component Labeling on a CPU using Unions. Note: This is the fastest on a CPU.
3. gpl.cu: An algorithm to solve graph component labeling on CUDA(GPU).
4. bfs.cu: An algorithm to solve Breadth First search on CUDA. This program was created to test the basic functionality on CUDA Devices.
5. Readme.txt: This file
6. Samplegraph.txt: Random sample graph used to check bfs.cu

One of the graph generator used in this project is implemented in 1 and 2. 
Note: Many other graph generators are utilized to fully test the project.
